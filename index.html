                <h1>Accredited Practising Dietitian</h1>
                <p>I’m an Accredited Practising Dietitian dedicated to helping individuals achieve their healthiest, happiest lives through sustainable and personalized nutrition solutions.
                </p>
                <p>I go beyond food by integrating science, lifestyle, and cultural preferences to create tailored, realistic nutrition plans.

                    With experience at Singapore’s Health Promotion Board, I’ve led workshops and demonstrations, helping individuals make informed dietary choices. My background as a former flight stewardess with Singapore Airlines has enhanced my ability to connect with people from diverse backgrounds, ensuring practical and approachable guidance.
                    
                    Passionate about health, wellness, and fitness—whether yoga, top rope climbing, or Pilates—I believe movement is key to a balanced lifestyle. Traveling and exploring cultures further enriches my understanding of global food traditions.
                    
                    I’m here to support you with expert, personalized guidance to improve your well-being, achieve health goals, and build a balanced lifestyle.
